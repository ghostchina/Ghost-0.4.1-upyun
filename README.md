# 支持又拍云存储的 Ghost

Ghost 目前仅支持将上传的文件（主要是图片）存储在 `content/images` 目录下面。此项目的目的是增加对又拍云存储的支持，也就是将上传到 Ghost 的图片存储到又拍云服务器上，本地服务器不保存。这样既能减轻自己服务器的压力，还能通过 CDN 加速图片载入。

## 增加的文件

主要是在 `core/server/storage` 目录增加了 `upyun` 目录（源码来自又拍云）和 `upyun.js` 文件（继承 `baseStore` 基类实现各个方法）。

## 修改的文件

修改了 `core/server/storage/index.js` 文件以支持加载 `upyun.js` 存储类。

```
var errors = require('../errorHandling'),
    storage;

//加载config.js中涉及又拍云的配置信息
var upyunConfig  = require('../config/')().upyun;

function get_storage() {
    // TODO: this is where the check for storage plugins should go
    // Local file system is the default
    //如果配置文件中配置了又拍云就启用又拍云存储
    var storageChoice = upyunConfig? 'upyun':'localfilesystem';

    if (storage) {
        return storage;
    }

    try {
        // TODO: determine if storage has all the necessary methods
        storage = require('./' + storageChoice);
    } catch (e) {
        errors.logError(e);
    }
    return storage;
}

module.exports.get_storage = get_storage;
```

## 配置

案例如下：

```
upyun: {
            bucketname: 'my-first-bucket', //空间名称
            username: 'somebody', //操作员名称
            password: 'secret', //密码
            root: '/images/', //文件存储在哪个目录。可以设置为 `/` 表示存储在根目录
            prefix: 'http://cdn.my-domainname.com'  //上传的文件的 URL 前缀，可以是你自己绑定的二级域名或者又拍云默认分配的二级域名。文件最中的 URL 为：prefix + root + md5(file) + extension
            例如：http://cdn.my-domainname.com/images/a/ab/dqwerqwetetqwedfasdf.png
        }
```

## 上传文件在又拍云上的存储结构

首先计算上传文件的 md5 值，然后取 md5 值的第1位字符作为一级目录名称，取第2和3位作为二级目录名称，剩余的字符作为文件名。例如：

某上传文件的 md5 值为：6fb2a38dc107eacb41cf1656e899cf70；扩展名为 .jpg ；目录及文件组织结构为：6/fb/2a38dc107eacb41cf1656e899cf70.jpg

## Getting Involved

Want to report a bug, request a feature, or help us build or translate Ghost? Check out our in depth guide to [Contributing to Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). We need all the help we can get! You can also join in with our [community](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost#community) to keep up-to-date and meet other Ghosters.



## Getting Started

There are **two** main ways to get started with Ghost, take care to use the method which best suits your needs.

**Please note** - the downloadable zip files we provide on [Ghost.org](http://ghost.org/download) are pre-built packages designed for getting started quickly. Cloning from the git repository requires you to install several dependencies and build the assets yourself. 

### Getting Started Guide for Bloggers

If you just want to get a Ghost blog running in the fastest time possible, this method is for you.

For detailed instructions for various platforms visit the [Ghost Installation Guide](http://docs.ghost.org/installation/). If you get stuck, help is available on [our forum](http://ghost.org/forum/).

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) - Ghost requires **Node v0.10.***
1. Download the latest Ghost package from [Ghost.org](http://ghost.org/download). 
   **If you cloned the GitHub repository you should follow the instructions [for developers](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost#getting-started-guide-for-developers).**
1. Create a new directory where you would like to run the code, and unzip the package to that location.
1. Fire up a terminal (or node command prompt in Windows) and change directory to the root of the Ghost application (where config.example.js and index.js are)
1. run `npm install --production` to install the node dependencies. If you see `error Error: ENOENT` on this step, make sure you are in the project directory and try again.
1. To start ghost, run `npm start`
1. Visit `http://localhost:2368/` in your web browser or go to `http://localhost:2368/ghost` to log in

Check out the [Documentation](http://docs.ghost.org/) for more detailed instructions, or get in touch via the [forum](http://ghost.org/forum) if you get stuck.



### Getting Started Guide for Developers

If you're a theme, app or core developer, or someone comfortable getting up and running from a `git clone`, this method is for you.

If you clone the GitHub repository, you will need to build a number of assets, such as SASS and JavaScript templates. This requires you to have Ruby and a number of other pre-requisites.
Full instructions can be found in the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) under the heading "[Working on Ghost Core](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#working-on-ghost-core)".

Check out the [Documentation](http://docs.ghost.org/) for more detailed instructions, or get in touch via the [forum](http://ghost.org/forum) if you get stuck.

### Updating with the latest changes

Documentation on updating can be found in the [Ghost Guide](http://docs.ghost.org/installation/upgrading/)

### Logging in For The First Time

Once you have the Ghost server up and running, you should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:2368/ghost/` from a web browser, where you will be prompted for a login.

1.  Click on the "register new user" link
2.  Enter your user details
3.  Return to the login screen and use those details to log in.

Note - this is still very alpha. Not everything works yet.

* A new *minor* release indicates a normal change that maintains backwards compatibility.
* A new *patch* release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.
* A new *build* release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.
